# Charity-Donations
Targetting Potential Donors to Maximize Donations

## Introduction

An important goal for any organization is to use its resources in the most efficient and economical way possible.  This is especially pertinent for non-profit and charitable firms.  Entities such as these are relying on donated funds and, as such, should put additional focus on maximizing available resources.  The objective of this research is to study data of a charitable organization in an effort to determine the most cost-effective methods of fund-raising when it comes to targeting donors for a direct marketing campaign.  

The research will first focus on evaluating models for classification based to a data set of a recent marketing campaign.  The goal will be to identify the set of donors that will yield the highest expected net return after factoring mailing and other costs.  The research will then shift to a prediction model in which the objective will be to estimate donation amounts for a given individual based upon that individualâ€™s characteristics.
